# To Do List App with Javascript

As a part of my internship at Codveda, i had to develop a todo list app using javascript. Here were the main objectives : 
* Use HTML and CSS for layout and design.
* Implement JavaScript for adding, updating, and deleting tasks.
* Store tasks in the browser’s local storage to persist data.
